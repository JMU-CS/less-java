How to build:  
    If you have gradle installed:  
        `gradle build`  
    If not:  
        `./gradlew build`   #unix  
        `gradlew build`     #windows  
        
How to run:  
    `gradle run`  

This runs with the test file "test.lj"  
Replace that file in build.gradle with your desired file.
